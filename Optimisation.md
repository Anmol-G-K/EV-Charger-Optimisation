# Meta Heuristics
- Meta-heuristic algorithm - general method to approach a solution space by smartly searching through a set of possibilities (search space).
	- They are nature inspired algorithms, commonly used where the problem exhibits dynamic nature, and exact solutions may not be possible.
	- They find near optimal solution, so the exact (perfect) solution is not given.
